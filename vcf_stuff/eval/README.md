Small variant validation
========================

## Workflow

`Snakefile` is a workflow file for validation of variant calling by comparing VCF files to truth set. Usage:

1. Prepare a `config.yaml` file similar to `config_eval_MB_grch37_spartan.yaml` or `config_eval_dream_grch37_local.yaml`. 
Not that `vcf_sample` should correspond to the main sample name in multi-sample VCF files.

2. Make sure all dependencies from `environment.yaml` are installed - e.g. create a new conda environment:
```
conda env create --name snakemake-validation --file environment.yaml
source activate snakemake-validation
```
3. Run snakemake in the directory where `Snakemake` file is located:
```
snakemake -p --configfile=config.yaml
```
